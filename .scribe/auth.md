# Authenticating requests

To authenticate requests, include a **`X-API-Key`** header with the value **`"your_api_key_here"`**.

All authenticated endpoints are marked with a `requires authentication` badge in the documentation below.

You can create API keys by visiting your <a href="/settings/api">API Settings</a> page in your dashboard. Include your API key in the <code>X-API-Key</code> header or as an <code>api_key</code> query parameter.
